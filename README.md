# Vision_Transformer_Transfer_Learning

Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become a leading choice for various computer vision tasks due to their state-of-the-art performance. Among them, some models stand out for transfer learning in different scenarios.


## ViT (Vanilla Vision Transformer)

**Description:** 
    The original Vision Transformer developed by Google. It divides images into patches, processes them as tokens, and applies transformer layers.
**Best For:** 
    General-purpose vision tasks when large-scale pretraining is available.
**Pre-trained Weights:** 
    Available on datasets like ImageNet-21k and ImageNet-1k.
**Transfer Learning Strength:** 
    Performs well for classification, particularly with fine-tuning on smaller datasets.
